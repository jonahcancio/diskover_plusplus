Cry of Balintawak by Ramon Martinez	Ala-ala ng Bayang Filipino sa mga Bayani ng ‘96 is a concrete polychromed statue done by Ramon Martinez between 1905 and 1911.  It was inaugurated in Balintawak on 3 September 1911 but was relocated to the U.P. Vinzons Hall in 29 November 1968 to give way to the construction of the North Luzon Expressway.  While often associated with Andres Bonifacio, it actually represents a nameless Katipunero. The statue is also popularly linked with the “Cry of Balintawak” because of its depiction of a katipunero’s battlecry.  Aptly located outside Vinzons Hall, the campus student center, it is a constant reminder of the brand of activism and nationalism that U.P. stands for. - SculpTour	14.6542931000000003	121.073204000000004	cry-of-balintawak-by-ramon-martinez	564	6	The statue is located in front of Vinzons Hall.

Sundial	After the destruction of the sundial in the front lawn of Melchor Hall, in 1972 the UP Alumni Engineers started the construction of the present-day sundial. It is located in G. Apacible St., now at the center of the engineering complex. It was Chato Calderon (CE’72) who was the supervising engineer. Following in the footsteps of her father, Quintin A. Calderon (CE’36) who was UPAE president 1970-1972, she was the first lady president of the UPAE.\r\n\r\nThe current sundial has a design similar to the one destroyed by Typhoon Yoling. At the base of its gnomon is the year 1947, which signifies the founding year of the UP Alumni Engineers. This shows how closely related the sundial is to the college of engineering as well as the great importance that the alumni of the college have given it. -iskWiki	14.6570797000000006	121.070487999999997	sundial	565	6	Behind DILC, along G.

Oblation by Guillermo Tolentino	The iconic symbol of the University of the Philippines, the Oblation is commonly associated with freedom and its various aspects.  Guillermo Tolentino however, inspired by the second stanza of Jose Rizal’s Mi Ultimo Adios, envisioned this monument with its nakedness and outstretched arms to exemplify the virtue of sacrifice in the name of country, thus the term.  Its base is an assembly of river stones to symbolize the archipelagic nature of the Philippines, and the kataka-taka leaves that grazes its legs and which is endemic to the country signifies the Filipino people.  The Oblation is an excellent portrayal of the classical ideals dignity, balance and restraint as demonstrated in its stance and proportions.\r\n\r\nMeasuring almost 5 meters tall, this statue was unveiled in 1935 by the first Filipino U.P. President, Rafael Palma.  In 1949, it was transferred from its original location in U.P. Manila to the Diliman campus escorted by a huge motorcade composed of students, faculty and staff. - SculpTour	14.6549090999999994	121.064887999999996	oblation-by-guillermo-tolentino	568	6	Take any jeep to either the University Press stop or the College of Music stop, then walk into the Academic Oval to Quezon Hall.

Cry of Balintawak by Ramon Martinez	Jeepney Stops	Ala-ala ng Bayang Filipino sa mga Bayani ng ‘96 is a concrete polychromed statue done by Ramon Martinez between 1905 and 1911.  It was inaugurated in Balintawak on 3 September 1911 but was relocated to the U.P. Vinzons Hall in 29 November 1968 to give way to the construction of the North Luzon Expressway.  While often associated with Andres Bonifacio, it actually represents a nameless Katipunero. The statue is also popularly linked with the “Cry of Balintawak” because of its depiction of a katipunero’s battlecry.  Aptly located outside Vinzons Hall, the campus student center, it is a constant reminder of the brand of activism and nationalism that U.P. stands for. - SculpTour	The statue is located in front of Vinzons Hall.	14.6542931000000003	121.073204000000004	cry-of-balintawak-by-ramon-martinez	564

Sundial	Jeepney Stops	After the destruction of the sundial in the front lawn of Melchor Hall, in 1972 the UP Alumni Engineers started the construction of the present-day sundial. It is located in G. Apacible St., now at the center of the engineering complex. It was Chato Calderon (CE’72) who was the supervising engineer. Following in the footsteps of her father, Quintin A. Calderon (CE’36) who was UPAE president 1970-1972, she was the first lady president of the UPAE.\r\n\r\nThe current sundial has a design similar to the one destroyed by Typhoon Yoling. At the base of its gnomon is the year 1947, which signifies the founding year of the UP Alumni Engineers. This shows how closely related the sundial is to the college of engineering as well as the great importance that the alumni of the college have given it. -iskWiki	Behind DILC, along G.

Oblation by Guillermo Tolentino	Jeepney Stops	The iconic symbol of the University of the Philippines, the Oblation is commonly associated with freedom and its various aspects.  Guillermo Tolentino however, inspired by the second stanza of Jose Rizal’s Mi Ultimo Adios, envisioned this monument with its nakedness and outstretched arms to exemplify the virtue of sacrifice in the name of country, thus the term.  Its base is an assembly of river stones to symbolize the archipelagic nature of the Philippines, and the kataka-taka leaves that grazes its legs and which is endemic to the country signifies the Filipino people.  The Oblation is an excellent portrayal of the classical ideals dignity, balance and restraint as demonstrated in its stance and proportions.\r\n\r\nMeasuring almost 5 meters tall, this statue was unveiled in 1935 by the first Filipino U.P. President, Rafael Palma.  In 1949, it was transferred from its original location in U.P. Manila to the Diliman campus escorted by a huge motorcade composed of students, faculty and staff. - SculpTour	Take any jeep to either the University Press stop or the College of Music stop, then walk into the Academic Oval to Quezon Hall.	14.6549090999999994	121.064887999999996	oblation-by-guillermo-tolentino	568
